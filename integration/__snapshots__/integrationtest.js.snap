We provide important daily social contact, a safety net system and resource/referral services as needed. The Congregate Program operates within senior centers and community centers throughout Yolo County. We provide a hot meal to seniors that are more active and can go to the site to eat. Seniors get a chance to get out of their homes to socialize with friends and attend activities at the centers. Meals are served throughout Yolo County in the cities of Woodland, Davis, West Sacramento, Winters, Knight's Landing, and Esparto.</p><p>Last year we served over 89,000 noon-meals (approximately 325 per day) to close to 1,300 seniors 60 years and older throughout Yolo County.</p>",

The Home Delivered Meal Program (\\"Meals on Wheels\\") provides an opportunity for \\"shut-ins\\" or homebound seniors to receive a hot, home delivered meal on a temporary or long term basis, for those seniors who cannot prepare meals for themselves and do not have family or friends to provide assistance. We provide important daily social contact, a safety net system and resource/referral services as needed. The Congregate Program operates within senior centers and community centers throughout Yolo County. We provide a hot meal to seniors that are more active and can go to the site to eat. Seniors get a chance to get out of their homes to socialize with friends and attend activities at the centers. Meals are served throughout Yolo County in the cities of Woodland, Davis, West Sacramento, Winters, Knight's Landing, and Esparto. Last year we served over 89,000 noon-meals (approximately 325 per day) to close to 1,300 seniors 60 years and older throughout Yolo County.",

WCA is open year round, seven days a week including holidays. Concerned citizens and other agencies bring us over 6000 sick, orphaned and injured wildlife each year. With the help of volunteers, interns, staff and local veterinarians, WCA provides medical services to these animals. Once the animals have recovered from their injuries or illness, or have grown and learned to hunt and fend for themselves, they are released into the wild, giving them a second chance in life.",

Please note that Wildlife Care Association is licensed by the State and Federal government to rehabilitate wild animals. When you volunteer with us, you are covered by our permits.",

We have nine branches, and two contract branches from Antelope Valley down to San Diego. We operate a toll free hotline that people call when they need some kind of spay/neuter assistance. Our branches each have a voicemail box, where the calls are answered by volunteers. Volunteers determine if a financial subsidy is needed, and then assist the pet owner to find a good low cost vet, and other sources of financial aid. Branches do fund raising in various ways. Our Long Beach/Lakewood branch does adoption rescue of cats and dogs. They always need help with animal care, socializing and the weekly weekend adoption events. We are working on opening a cat adoption center/head office/thrift-boutique in 2011 and will need volunteers to help staff the store.",
